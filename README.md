# heart-failure-prediction
This project leverages the Decision Tree algorithm to predict heart failure outcomes based on patient data. The approach highlights the effectiveness of Decision Trees in identifying critical patterns in medical datasets. This repository includes the dataset, code, and detailed documentation to replicate and understand the prediction process.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (heart_failure_prediction.ipynb) for predicting heart failure outcomes using the Decision Tree algorithm. The dataset used in this project was acquired from Kaggle.

**Methodology**
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized the dataset, handling missing values for improved data quality.

**Model Training:** Applied the Decision Tree algorithm to predict heart failure based on features like age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, etc.

**Model Evaluation:** Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets to evaluate model performance. Achieved an accuracy of 99% in predicting heart failure.

**Insights**
**Binary Classification:** Decision Tree demonstrated strong performance as a binary classifier, effectively distinguishing between patients with and without heart failure.

**Future Work:**
Explore ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting to enhance model robustness.
Incorporate additional features such as lifestyle factors and genetic information for more personalized predictions.
**Usage**
**Clone the Repository:**
